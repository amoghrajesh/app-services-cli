[cluster.connect.cmd.longDescription]
one = '''
Connect your application services to your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.
The kubeconfig file is used to connect to the cluster and identify the context.
Alternatively, you can use the KUBECONFIG environment variable to read your configuration.

NOTE: This command requires the RHOAS operator to be running on your cluster.

This command will:

1. Create a service account and mount it as a secret into your cluster.
If the cluster has a service account, it will be refreshed.

2. Create a Kafka Request object that can be used to create a ServiceBinding object using
the Service Binding operator (https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator).
